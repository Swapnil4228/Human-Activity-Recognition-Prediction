# Human-Activity-Recognition-Prediction
This presentation delves into the world of human activity recognition (HAR), exploring the power of grid search in optimizing model performance. We'll uncover the challenges, opportunities, and advancements in this dynamic field.
 Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is an essential field in machine learning that focuses
 on classifying various human activities, such as walking, running, sitting, standing, and
 jumping, based on sensor data. HAR has gained widespread attention due to its diverse
 applications in healthcare, fitness tracking, security, and smart home environments. For
 instance, in healthcare, HAR can be used to monitor elderly individuals, detect falls, and
 assist in rehabilitation. In fitness applications, it helps track physical activity, optimize
 workout routines, and enhance performance analysis.[1] Moreover, in security and
 surveillance, HAR aids in detecting suspicious activities and improving safety measures.
 Traditional HAR methods relied on manual feature engineering and rule-based
 approaches, which required domain expertise and were often limited in their ability to
 handle complex activities. However, machine learning algorithms have significantly
 improved the accuracy and efficiency of activity recognition by automatically learning
 patterns from large datasets. Despite these advancements, choosing the best model and
 optimizing its performance remains a challenge. Different machine learning models
 perform variably depending on the dataset, and their accuracy can be affected by
 hyperparameters, feature selection, and model complexity
 In this study, we investigate multiple machine learning models for HAR and apply Grid
 Search optimization to fine-tune their hyperparameters for improved performance. The
 selected models include Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, RBF SVM, Decision Tree, and
 Random Forest. These models are evaluated based on accuracy and error rates to
 determine the most effective classifier for HAR. Our research aims to provide insights into
 the performance of different models and highlight the importance of hyperparameter
 tuning in optimizing HAR systems. By fine-tuning parameters, we seek to enhance model
 performance, making HAR more reliable, scalable, and applicable to real-world scenarios.
 This study contributes to the ongoing research in HAR by systematically comparing
 traditional machine learning models and optimizing their hyperparameters. The findings
 will help guide future research and applications in HAR, paving the way for more efficient
 and accurate activity recognition systems.
